                        Team Sammard is in collaboration with Bharat Scouts and Guide, Karnataka, in their ongoing project SATCAN, which was inaugurated on 19th June. SATCAN aims at imparting STEM education to school and college students by teaching them how to build a can-sized satellite through a series of weekly workshops. Over 160 students around the globe were selected for this event, who will learn and build their own miniature satellite, and launch it in the near future with the facilities provided to them.

                        Team Sammard in collaboration with Star Labs organized an online session on “MARS - The next Giant Leap” where forty-five plus space enthusiasts from and outside VIT had joined to witness Mr. Sunny Kabrawala, CEO of Star Labs share a few facts about MARS. It was an interactive session where the audience flooded the speaker with questions varying from aerospike engines, Ingenuity helicopter in MARS to commercialisation of space and future colonization in MARS. The speaker also talked about his start-up’s future projects and contribution in the Indian space arena. The speaker was more than eager to address all the questions asked and answer them in layman terms for easy understanding. The session got extended by an hour due to enthusiasm of both the audience and the speaker. Overall, it was a very informative session and a very interactive one where in the end everyone gained something from it.

                        As World Space Week came to an end, we organized a Space Voyage discussing the mind-boggling and awe-striking topics of rocket stability, rocket projectile, and propulsion systems. Team Sammard is VIT's official rocketry team, and our experience and expertise in rocket science compelled us to share our knowledge. We discussed the various subsystems and mechanisms implemented in rockets to stabilize the flight and ensure that the rocket's flight trajectory remains unaltered. The discussion also included an overview of all the various types of propulsion systems. We used the Airmeet platform to conduct the event with over 50 students from all over the campus and from various other colleges attending the event. It marked a fitting end to the entire World Space Week by bringing like minded enthusiasts together.
